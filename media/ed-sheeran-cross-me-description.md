An insane amount of VFX were created in very short order for this video for Ed Sheeran's latest track 'Cross Me' featuring Chance the Rapper and PnB Rock.

We begin in a studio with a dancer wearing a mocap suit. We see her perform the dance routine which is then applied to CG avatars of the three artists, in an increasingly glitchy intersection of reality with feverishly imagined fantasy worlds.

My small contribution was creating environments for a running track and a baseball pitch, and lighting characters for kung fu and underwater snippets.
