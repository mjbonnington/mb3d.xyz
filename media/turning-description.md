In this beautifully realised short film from directing duo Karni and Saul, a young boy receives three old ladies in his mother's sitting room on his sixth birthday. The ten minute film uses a combination of live action with both stop-frame and CG animation to deliver its dark and dreamlike vision of hazy childhood memory and imagination. My contribution to this was a scene where an elaborately wrapped present scuttles across the floor, spider-like, with ribbons as legs. 'Turning' was nominated for Best Short Film in the 2011 BAFTA awards.
