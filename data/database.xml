		<description>Betfair pays homage to Paul the Octopus, who correctly predicted the outcome of games during the 2010 World Cup, in this ad campaign launched ahead of the 2014 tournament in Brazil. The spot stars an octopus playing (and winning) four games of table tennis simultaneously. The ad was shown during ITV's World Cup coverage. As part of the same campaign, viewers may recall a publicity stunt where a truck carrying a giant model of the octopus conveniently broke down right in the middle of Oxford Circus.</description>

		<description>Four short teasers for the 2010 series of &amp;quot;I'm a Celebrity...&amp;quot; which see the ITV1 logo being torn apart by creeping vines, wrapped in a spider's web, sinking into quicksand and finally gobbled up by a venus fly trap. I worked exclusively on the vines spot, which posed many 3D challenges including the creation of a realistic mossy, barky procedural texture for the vines, giving the logo a dirty, weathered look, bringing the vines to life with a creepy, time-lapse style of animation and cracking and breaking the logo into pieces.</description>

The video was shot in September 2009, and working in my spare time over the subsequent year, I developed the aesthetic, created the 3D environments and composited the entire video. This also involved me doing more green screen removal than I care to think about. Elesha took part in the X-Factor 2010 and made it through to the judges' houses stage of the competition, her place in the finals denied to her by Wagner! Word is she'll be competing again in 2011 so keep an eye out!</description>

		<description>I did visual effects work on two sequences in the latest Harry Potter: firstly a scene in the woods where Harry, Hermione and Ron attempt to destroy a horcrux - a locket with mystical powers. I animated the locket itself and used hair simulation dynamics to create the locket's chain. Secondly, in which Bellatrix (played by Helena Bonham-Carter) uses a magic spell which causes a black snake to materialise and strangle her adversary. This was the first creature work I had done in a while and I modelled, textured and lit the snake.</description>

		<description>Tuborg, the Danish beer owned by Carlsberg, has recently become sponsors of festivals and music events throughout Europe, and these idents were created for this purpose. I worked on two of the four, 'Festival' and 'Dance', the other two being 'Indie' and 'Hip-Hop'. The work mostly involved preparation of pre-supplied high detail models, to make them suitable for animation and deformation. This usually involved extensive re-modelling. I then animated the various guitars, amps, speakers and the like to swoop around the bottle. I also made Maya hair based dynamics for some of the cables. In addition I developed shaders and lighting resulting in the finished look.</description>

		<description>In this beautifully realised short film from directing duo Karni and Saul, a young boy receives three old ladies in his mother's sitting room on his sixth birthday. The ten minute film uses a combination of live action with both stop-frame and CG animation to deliver its dark and dreamlike vision of hazy childhood memory and imagination, My contribution to this was a scene where an elaborately wrapped present scuttles across the floor, spider-like, with ribbons as legs. 'Turning' was nominated for Best Short Film in the 2011 BAFTA awards.

		<description>A 'music and motorsport extravaganza', F1 Rocks is a series of rock concerts coinciding with Formula 1 Grand Prix race weekends in cities across the world. The inaugural show was held in Singapore on the 24th-26th September, and this is the 30 second opening names for the televised event, to be shown in over 40 countries. Production was a combination of 2D and 3D, with creation of the 3D scenes including camera animation created by myself in Maya, then exported to After Effects where additional imagery and particle simulations could be added to the scene. I modelled a number of 3D elements, including the F1 car, for which I then developed rendering and post-production techniques to produce the final, abstract look.</description>

		<description>The sixth movie in the blockbusting Harry Potter series features an animated end credits sequence in which the names form out of clouds of ink. The job was completed in October 2008 but the film wasn't released until July 2009. The three-and-a-half-minute sequence uses one continuous camera flythrough within a volumetric liquid-like substance. The ink clouds are a combination of live action and CG created with Maya Fluids. I was the sole 3D artist on the project.</description>

		<description>Design your own trainers with the K-Swiss classic sneaker as the canvas, in this competition advert made in conjunction with MTV. As our hero mixes, scratches, paints, dances and drums in the background, animated graphics adorn the surface of the shoe like graffiti, eventually coming to life and filling the entire space with colour. Mostly live action, the graphics were added later and I was tasked with giving them a realistic appearance. In one shot - where the shoe spins and paint flies off - the live action shoe is replaced by a CG shoe which I created and animated.</description>

		<description>In this series of six sponsorship idents for Royal Bank of Scotland, ranging from five to 15 seconds in length, the words 'RBS Mortgages' spin and morph in 3D to transform into a variety of houses. Based on designs by director Filipe Al&amp;ccedil;ada, their visual style is clean, simple and appealing, and are a mixture of 3D and Flash animation. I produced the entirety of the 3D for three of the six idents: 'Tree', 'Garden Path', and 'Scottish Villa'. They are to be shown initially in Scotland for sponsorship of property related shows on Channel 4, such as Grand Designs, Location Location Location and Property Ladder.</description>

The two versions contain other subtle differences - including the design of the balcony overlooking the city, the screening room behind the TV, and a horse is replaced by a car in the Polish version. The majority of backgrounds were created in post using a mix of 3D and digital matte paintings, and composited with the live action elements. I designed and built sections of the 3D cityscape, modelling and texturing several buildings and the screening room backdrop in the Polish version.</description>

		<description>Here we have a stop-motion name sequence for Market Kitchen, a cookery show on digital channel UKTV Food. The time lapse sequence shows a crate containing a whole year of seasonal food in 24 seconds. I embellished the stop-motion work with some minor CG effects: a butterfly in spring, flowering thyme leaves in summer, falling leaves in autumn and snow in winter.</description>

		<description>Father Christmas rides a bike to Halfords to collect presents for all the family in this CG spot for Halfords' Christmas campaign. Agency M&amp;amp;C Saatchi must have had their finest minds developing that concept all year! Sarcasm aside, it's turned out to be a nice job, despite a particularly punishing budget and schedule. I built, textured and lit environments and backgrounds, based on a warm, painted style. In the completed commercials, the ten seconds of 3D animation is cut together with product shots illustrating various promotions in the run up to Christmas.</description>

		<description>I can't claim any credit for the ad itself: I just made the chocolate bar for the packshot at the end. This deceptively straightforward job involved animating the milk pouring from the glasses, making a splash on the chocolate chunk, and mapping the animation on to the pack. So, rather mundane then, but nevertheless interesting to have been involved in such a high profile (and frankly, bizarre) job.</description>

		<description>This 30 second CG/stop-frame TV and cinema spot is something of a departure from conventional cereal adverts. Coco Pops mascot Coco the Monkey has been relegated to a cameo role on the side of the cereal box, this time the real stars are the Coco Pops themselves. The CG elements needed to match the look of the stop frame animation, which provided some interesting challenges: in one shot I had to recreate the fan in CG, as the stop motion animators had forgotten to turn the fan blades! My main task was to develop a procedural generator to create the Coco Pops models and shaders.</description>

He gets sucked through a jet engine, freefalls through a hot air balloon's burners, gets shot at by a clay pigeon shooter, and plummets through the branches of a particularly spiky tree. This is the third commercial produced for Ribena, and it's a bit of a departure as it's almost entirely CG, unlike the previous two which were predominantly live action with CG elements. I modelled and textured the truck, and worked on lighting, rendering and compositing of the rest of the ad.</description>

		<description>I created photorealistic textures from digital photographs and video footage, and modelled buildings to create a virtual representation of London. The game was a big success for Sony, despite being almost five years in development. Unfortunately the lengthy gestation period, mainly spent on the mammoth task of recreating miles of London streets, caused the game to lose ground to its competitors. Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto III and GTA: Vice City - both of which came out during The Getaway's development period - were similar games but superior in almost all regards with the exception of the visuals. A hastily put together sequel, Black Monday, was released later and received a widespread critical mauling.</description>

However, the game failed to live up to its (admittedly great) potential, the finished product being somewhat linear, clunky, and feeling slightly unfinished.

		<description>Take the pedestrians to their destinations in Boona style in the psuedo-sequel to Boona Racer 2000. Boona Taxi was developed for the Innovations in Computer Animation unit of my degree. The idea is based on Sega's Crazy Taxi (although to be honest it's more of a direct rip-off).</description>

		<format>PS2 game character</format>

		<description>In our final year of Uni we were visited by Sony Cambridge, who set us a brief to design, build and animate a character for a Playstation 2 game. We were given limits on the amount of polygons and texture sizes we could use. Jasper here was inspired by Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle, although my initial design was not received particularly well by the Sony chaps. I redesigned the character in a more comic book style, made him more muscular, and as a joke I gave him a somewhat bigger gun (not pictured). Predictably they much preferred it!</description>

		<description>A third-person tactical shooting game, written in C and OpenGL. It was developed by myself and Martin Johnson in May 2000, for the Specialist Project module of the second year of our degree. It's inspired in parts by Metal Gear Solid, Wolfenstein 3D and Goldeneye. Unlike Boona Racer 2000 I took a more technical role, programmming a large part of the game engine as well as character design, modelling, texturing and animation.</description>

		<description>A group project undertaken over the autumn 1999 and spring 2000 terms of the second year of our degree. The game is a 3D futurisic racing game featuring hover cars, inspired by games such as F-Zero and Wipeout. My tasks were vehicle design and texturing, and in-game graphic design (fonts, HUD, presentation screens, etc.) This was our first attempt at writing a game, and was a great experience for all involved.</description>
